# Pitch and Fix Hackathon: E-Commerce Debug & Improve Challenge

Welcome to the "Pitch and Fix" hackathon challenge! This repository contains a buggy e-commerce website that needs your expertise to fix and enhance.

## Challenge Overview

This hackathon simulates a real-world scenario where you've inherited a client's e-commerce website with various issues. Your mission has two parts:

1. **Fix**: Identify and repair all bugs in the existing codebase
2. **Pitch**: Propose and implement a valuable new feature

## Important Dates

- **Start Date**: April 21, 2025
- **Registration Deadline**: April 23, 2025
- **Submission Deadline**: May 5, 2025 (11:59 PM)

## Repository Contents

- `/css` - Stylesheet files
- `/js` - JavaScript files
- `/images` - Image assets
- `/pages` - Additional HTML pages
- `index.html` - Main homepage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- Basic text editor or IDE
- Understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

### Setup Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository:
2. Open the project in your preferred code editor

## The Challenge

### Phase 1: The Fix

The e-commerce website has several bugs and issues. Your task is to:

1. Find all bugs (both visual and functional)
2. Fix the issues while maintaining original functionality
3. Create a brief report explaining your debugging process (This can just be some notes to yourself so you remember all the bugs you fixed for the video)

   _If you are unsure if it is a bug - use your best judgement as to how you would want a site to work - but be ready to explain the reason any code in this repo is the way it is - there are some unique ways this code is written that may not be optimal_

Types of bugs you might encounter:

- CSS styling and layout issues
- HTML structure problems
- JavaScript functionality errors
- Form validation problems
- Cart calculation errors
- Navigation issues
- Responsive design problems
- Accessibility violations
- Image loading issues
- Event handler problems

### Phase 2: The Pitch

After fixing the existing issues:

1. Analyze the site to identify opportunities for improvement
   - look at feature-ideas.md for a short list of ideas - but you can implement anything you'd like
2. Implement the feature
3. Create a short demonstration of your solution

## Submission Requirements

Your final submission should include:

1. Your GitHub repository link with the fixed and improved code
2. A 5-minute video demonstration of your solution ( each team member must have a video about the feature they implemented)
3. Team information (if applicable)

## Evaluation Criteria

Your submission will be evaluated based on:

- **Bug Identification & Resolution**

  - Thoroughness in finding issues
  - Quality and cleanliness of fixes
  - Documentation of debugging process

- **Feature Addition**

  - Relevance and value to the e-commerce site
  - Creativity and innovation
  - Quality of integration

- **Implementation**

  - Technical quality of code
  - Adherence to best practices
  - Feature completeness and usability

- **Documentation & Communication**
  - Code comments and documentation
  - Clarity of explanation
  - Presentation quality

## Resources Allowed
